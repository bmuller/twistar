= Prerequisites =
You must first install Twisted core.  If you intent on generating API documentation,
you will need pydoctor.  If you want to generate the user documentation, you will
need to install Twisted Lore.  You will need to install the sqlite3 python package
if you want to run tests.

Your database must be one of: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.  The only DBAPI modules
supported by Twistar are: MySQLdb, psycopg2, and sqlite3 - at least one of these
must be installed.
